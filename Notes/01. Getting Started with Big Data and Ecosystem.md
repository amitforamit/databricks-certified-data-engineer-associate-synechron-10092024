# Getting Started with Big Data and Ecosystem

> Big Data refers to the data which is **large, fast and complex type** of structured , semi-structured and unstructured generated from variety of different sources which becomes **difficult to store and process using a traditional processing system**

**Challenges of Big Data**

1. Storage : Distributed Storage System
2. Processing : MPP (Massive Parallel Processing Framework)

## Distributed System

> A Distributed System is a collection of computer systems that are physically separated but are linked together

## Hadoop (Distributed Storage and Parallel Processing Framework)

> Apache Hadoop is a software framework that allows us to **store and process large datasets** in parallel and distributed fashion

* Hadoop framework is written in Java

## Components of Hadoop

Hadoop consists of three main components

1. Storage Layer - HDFS
2. Resource Management Layer - YARN
3. Data Processing Layer - MapReduce (v2)

## Hadoop Daemon Services

1. NameNode
2. DataNode
3. SecondaryNameNode
4. ResourceManager
5. NodeManager

## HDFS and Architecture

> HDFS is a **Distributed and Scalable FS** <u>designed for storing very large files.</u>

**Distributed**

* In HDFS , files are stored across multiple machines, instead of storing a file on a single node. HDFS splits the file into smaller pieces, called blocks and distributes these blocks across different machines in the cluster
* By default the block size in 128 MB (Hadoop 2.x ) w.r.t to Hadoop 1.x (64 MB)
